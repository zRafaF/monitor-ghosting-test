# Monitor Ghosting Test

This is a simple test to check for ghosting on your monitor. Ghosting is when the pixels on your monitor can't keep up with the refresh rate, causing a trail to follow moving objects. This can be a problem in fast-paced games or movies.

Usually on VA panels with high refresh rates, you can see a ghosting effect when scrolling up and down. It can show as blur or a darken of the text. This is a test to see if you can see it on your monitor.
